# EXPERIMENT-4
# AIM: 
This program aims to demonstrate the bitwise operations and shifts in C++ using predefined integer values for variables a and b.
# THEORY: 
In the provided C++ program, the following variable initializations are made: a is initialized to 5 (int a = 5;) and b is initialized to 3 (int b = 3;).
The program performs the following bitwise operations:
- AND (a & b): Performs a bitwise AND operation between a and b, resulting in 1 (101 & 011 in binary).
- OR (a | b): Performs a bitwise OR operation between a and b, resulting in 7 (101 | 011 in binary).
- XOR (a ^ b): Performs a bitwise XOR operation between a and b, resulting in 6 (101 ^ 011 in binary).
- NOT (~a): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a, resulting in -6 (the bitwise complement of 5).
- LEFT SHIFT (a << b): Shifts the bits of a left by b positions, resulting in 40 (101 << 3 in binary).
- RIGHT SHIFT (a >> b): Shifts the bits of a right by b positions, resulting in 0 (101 >> 3 in binary).
 # CONCLUSION:
The program successfully demonstrates the basic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and shifts (LEFT_SHIFT, RIGHT_SHIFT) in C++. Each operation's result is printed to the console, showcasing how these operations manipulate the bits of integer values a and b. The output matches the expected values based on binary arithmetic, confirming the correctness of the bitwise operations and shifts implemented in the program.
